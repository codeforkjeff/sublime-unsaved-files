# List Unsaved Files in Sublime Text

This package adds a new command "List Unsaved Files." It creates a new buffer
listing all the unsaved files in the current window. Clicking on a line
navigates to the file.

While Sublime Text prevents losing any unsaved changes, I find it useful
to generate this list periodically to review "temporary" buffers I've created
containing notes or code fragments that should be saved to disk or moved elsewhere.
I usually have a lot of these lying around.
